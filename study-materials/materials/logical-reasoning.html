I've updated the study materials page and created all the necessary preview pages:

1. **Study Materials Page Updates:**
   - Removed all download buttons
   - Kept only the preview buttons
   - Made the preview buttons more prominent
   - Ensured all preview links point to the correct HTML pages

2. **Created Preview Pages for:**
   - Nepal Geography
   - Nepali Grammar
   - English Proficiency
   - Mathematics
   - Logical Reasoning

Each preview page includes:
- A comprehensive header with the title and category
- Detailed content with sections and subsections
- Proper formatting with headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables
- Important points highlighted
- Navigation back to the study materials page
- Consistent styling with the main site
- Responsive design for all devices

The preview pages are now fully functional and provide valuable study content for Lok Sewa preparation. Users can easily navigate between different study materials and access the content they need.
